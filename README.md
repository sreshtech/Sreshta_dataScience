# Customer Segmentation using Clustering

This project segments customers based on their transaction data and attributes using clustering techniques. It leverages **K-Means Clustering** to group customers based on their spending behavior and frequency of purchases. The project evaluates cluster quality with the **Davies-Bouldin Index** and visualizes the results using scatter plots and PCA.

## Features:
- Preprocesses data to calculate total spend and purchase frequency.
- Uses K-Means clustering to segment customers.
- Evaluates clusters with the Davies-Bouldin Index.
- Visualizes clusters through 2D scatter and PCA plots.

## Requirements:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies.
